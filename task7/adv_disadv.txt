Advantages and disadvantages of Linux multiplexing I/O primitives select/poll/epoll:

SELECT
1) -modification of fd_set
2) -MAX_FD == 1024
3) -UB when changing the handle by another thread
4) -the handle on which the event occurred is unknown
5) -it is required to calculate max_num == MAX(fds)+1;
6) +portability
7) +high accuracy (~ns under appropriate conditions)

POLL
1) + better pollfd structuring
2) + does not change pollfd[]
3) + there is no limit on the number of descriptors in 1024
4) - accuracy (1ms)
5) - portability
6) - definability of descriptors without traversal
7) - inability to override descriptors automatically

EPOLL
1) + scalability
2) - only for Linux
3) - some cumbersomeness of the API
